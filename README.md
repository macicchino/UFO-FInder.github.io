## Summary:

### The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage:
  
    - The user need to enter lowercase letters. If they do not, the search will not return the intended result as it is case sensitive. 
    
### The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development:

    - I think the code should automatically change the user input within javascript in order to lowcase to avoid case sensitivity. This also could be done for states to handle both abbrieviations and the full state name ( NY and New York ). 
    - Using google mapping API's I think it would be useful to pull the location from the table and display them on an interative map within the web page. For example, a person would look up a specific data and see where those UFO sighting occured relative to one another on a map.
